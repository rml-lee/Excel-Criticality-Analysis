# Project Description
As a Data Analyst Intern for the Fulton County Sheriff's Office IT Department, I contributed to the development of a Critical Systems Application Catalog, creating a centralized repository for online services and tools. I assisted in gathering data on various applications, evaluating their criticality, and devising guidelines to address redundancies. By constructing a detailed dataset from this information, I performed a criticality analysis that has become a crucial component of the office's risk assessment and has notably improved operational efficiency.
